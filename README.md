This is a CFWheels Plugin to override the sendEmail() attributes when you are in design, development
and maintenance mode.
Currently it creates a table in MySQL called developmentEmails and you set your attributes on the
index.cfm page
To use this plugin, zip these files and call it developmentemails-0.1.zip

If you have questions, you can email me at cathyshapiro@gmail.com
